# Go programming language (Golang)

## Variables

All vars in Go are initialized to their zero values when declared:

* numeric types -> `0`
* strings -> `""`
* Booleans -> `false`
* pointers -> `nil`

Receive from channel `<- ch`

Send to channel `ch <-`

*array* - numbered sequence of elements of a single type with a fixed length

*slice* - segment of an array; like an array, it's indexable and has a length; unlike array, this length is allowed to change

*map* - unordered collection of key/value pairs (associative array, hash table, dictionary)

*pointer* - references a location in memory where a value is stored rather than the value itself
